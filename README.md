# SovereignKeep

This repo holds open source software for version control cloud hosting, encrypted key storage, and a hardened nginx server to access the services.

### Intended Use
This repo is the software companion to the legal services available at SovereignKeep.com. This software is designed to provide the maximum amount of legal protection for developers and companies interacting/working with/developing blockchain software. In order to get the most protection allowed by Wyoming Statute 34-29-103 and Wyoming Draft House Bill 2-35-203 the following precautions should be taken:

  - Host this software at a server geolocated in Wyoming, USA. [Wyo-Host]( https://www.sectorlink.com/location/state/wyoming)
  - Be a registered company in Wyoming. [More Info](https://www.corporatedirect.com/)


### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (already included with some Docker installations)
- For maximum legal protections as outlined above, you'll want to be a company registered in Wyoming. You may want to use [OpenLaw](https://www.openlaw.io) to help register your legal entity.


### Running
`docker-compose up`
